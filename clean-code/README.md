# Clean Code

This repository contain exercises of how to refactor a big function to a more readable
code code step by step from Uncle Bob (UB) who is the author of Clean
Code.

## Key Points

- How big should a function be? 20 Lines? A screen-ful? Is there a way
to know if your functions are the right size?
    > Not more than 4-6 lines.
    > To know the exact size, keep on extracting the method until you can't.
    And the best part is, it will automatically bring you down to 4-6 lines.

- Object Oriented Design involves the art of breaking applications into
classes. But have you found all the classes in the design of your
application? Is there a way to know?
    > Refactoring the large function is the best way to know hidden classes.

- Functions are supposed to do "One Thing", do it well, and do it only.
But what is "One Thing". Is there a way to tell if your functions are
obeying that rule?
    > Extract the Method. If it can be done then it is doing more than one thing.
