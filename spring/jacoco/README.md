# Jacoco Code Coverage

## Criteria to consider when writing tests
- We want to make sure that the parts of the code that are best tested
 are the parts that are most likely to contain bugs.

- We want to focus our tests on parts of the application that are critical,
the parts where bugs are most likely to lead to a bad outcome for our customers.

- We donâ€™t want to write tests that repeatedly cover the same areas of the code
while ignoring other parts of the code.
